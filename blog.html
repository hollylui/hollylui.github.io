                      I found a lemon with fungi in the refrigerate. Normally, I
                      would throw it away. And this time, I would like to dry it
                      and use it as Christmas decoration. Hope it has enough
                      time to dry out :).

                      When I checked the word, citrus, I just found out that
                      lemon tree or citrus is evergreen tree (OMG). Why I was so
                      surprise? As last year, I bought a lemon tree around
                      August. Then all the leaves fell down during the winter
                      time and it didn’t come back. I still keep it and then one
                      day (I guess between Spring and Summer), there is another
                      new branch came from the mother branch. Right now, all my
                      other plants such as plum, grape, cherry, their leaves
                      have fallen down. I was expecting when the lemon, mandarin
                      orange and orange one would be too… but they are still
                      green!!!

                      Eggs were on sale in the supermarket and I watched a video
                      from YouTube how to make Japanese soft boiled eggs few
                      days ago, so I decided to make some. Unfortunately I
                      forget which video I watched…but here you could find
                      million thousand of videos about it.

                      My kid is in the school. My husband is taking a nap. Have
                      some “me” time. Outside is cold and raining. I have a
                      taste of sweet and barbecue marshmallow would be good fit
                      to my tummy. So, I prepared one-man marshmallow to have
                      this creamy and ice-cream like marshmallow.

                      I bought a fiddle fig about half year ago. I would like to
                      propagate to another plant and make more branch. I
                      reviewed few videos from YouTube. All of them said it is
                      easy to propagate fiddle leaf fig such as just cutting the
                      branch. Let’s look my result.

                      We tried our best to take advantage of the sunny day. This

                      is about 27 min. driving from Kirchheim unter Teck. You
                      walked around the lake (see in German) and you would found
                      a lot of things to explore with your kids. This is also
                      main reason my husband and I went there so my kid would
                      not keep asking: “are we done yet?”. Some nice pictures
                      are shown below.

                      Cutting is one of important lesson for cooking. I am not
                      expert but I watched a lot of cooking show. From time to
                      time, the chef would show how you should hold the knife
                      and how you should cut the food. Still, old habit is
                      difficult to change. Then, I tried to teach my kid as much
                      as I can how to use a knife… also, peeling is the
                      on-the-way skill for Lucy to prepare baked potatoes.

                      Every peeling and cutting my kid did, I also had phobia
                      that Lucy would cut or hurt her finger until she finished
                      it. I tried to not think too much but my heart cannot be
                      controlled…

                      It is Autumn holiday. I don’t want my kid staying home all
                      the time. I found this place with some fun for kid to go
                      hiking. We live in Kirchheim unter Teck and Sinneswandel
                      is about 16 min. from our home. At the end, we walked
                      around for 2 hours. Below are some pictures I took and you
                      can even see purple mushrooms.

                      It is Autumn holiday. I don’t want my kid staying home all
                      the time. I found this place with some fun for kid to go
                      hiking. We live in Kirchheim unter Teck and Sinneswandel
                      is about 16 min. from our home. At the end, we walked
                      around for 2 hours. Below are some pictures I took and you
                      can even see purple mushrooms.

                      The first time I eat bread with salted bean curd when I
                      was 10… or…. (let’s say 30 years ago…) One day, my mom
                      made a toast and spread salted bean curd on it. Wow, the
                      taste you could never forget if you like it. So, in
                      Germany, you can find salted bean curd easily in any Asian
                      store and don’t need to talk about bread.

                      Toast the bread and then spread the salted bean curd on
                      the toast evenly. If you think it is a little salty, you can add some sugar on it to balance the taste.

                      My mom gave me this tradition Japanese snack. The Japanese
                      snack is quite funny for me. They are not specially tasty
                      but you will keep non-stop eating it. So, I tried to
                      introduce these 10 kinds of snack. In these 10 different
                      snacks, I would recommend No. 5 味付け片口いわし (Seasoned
                      Anchovy). It tastes sweet and a little bit bitter. I guess
                      that is because of viscera from the fish. The next one
                      will be No. 7 いか天 (Squid). It looks like squid and
                      really has some taste of squid. The last one I recommended
                      is No. 1 枝豆スチック (Edamame), No. 2 焼海老スナック
                      (Grilled Shrimp) and No. 6 海老せん (Shrimp). If you
                      closed your eyes and ate them, you may not divide which
                      one is which one but at least they are crispy and some
                      taste of seafood.

                      I have enough boiled potatoes, mashed potatoes, baked
                      potatoes, french fries, etc. I want potatoes but something
                      fast and easy. My mom invented this Fried Potatoes when I
                      was a kid. Then, it becomes a standard dish during the
                      dinner time. One day, I traveled with my parents in China
                      during the winter time. It was so cold as we were in the
                      mountain. Finally we found a restaurant and there is “this
                      dish” in the menu (In China, they called 炒土豆. It means
                      the pea in the soil) . I immediately ordered it to fulfill
                      my hunger but I have forgotten how it tasted…

                      So, pretty simple. Peel the potatoes’ skin, wash the
                      potatoes, slide it and cut it as thin strips. Heat up the
                      pan with oil and then add potatoes. Stir fry until the
                      potatoes turn semi-transparency and soft. Then sprinkle
                      salt on top of it. Stir fry again until mixing well.

                      This dish is simple but not easy. You need to slide the
                      potatoes very very thin. You need to cut the potatoes’
                      strips very very thin too. If your cutting skill is not
                      good enough (like me), you may fry “french fries”. So, I
                      tried but you can see that I am one of the persons who has
                      no patient and no skill…

                      Every year, my parents come to Germany and visit their
                      grandchild (yes, not me). Every time, my mom bought a log
                      of herbs, Asian ingredients, snacks, etc., to us
                      (actually, just me to tough it. My kid and husband don’t
                      like these kinds of Asian foods.) So, I have a lot of
                      mushrooms, a lot of herbal tea, a lot of a lot of a lot of
                      something I never ever can finish it alone. Last weekend,
                      I tried to clean up the storage room. I found some dried
                      mushroom and million thousand of cherry fungus. I made a
                      promise to myself that I have to finish all these cherry
                      fungus. So, this [Stir Fried Three Vegetables] is

                      strips. Squeeze out the water from soften mushroom and
                      then remove the stem and cut into strips.

                      I like to watch Korean variety shows such as [Boss in the
                      Mirror], [Star’s Top Recipe at Fun-Staurant] and some
                      youtube channel such as [Wassup Man], [YangBoss MakTube],
                      etc. They show this Korean fried chicken from time to
                      time. Living in Germany is not easy to find Korean food. I
                      decided to make my own one.

                      <li>
                        Coating: Mix all these – Flour (405), garlicpowder,
                        paprika powder, curry powder, salt, baking powder and
                        onion powder as I couldn’t find it in the local
                        supermarket.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Batter: Take half coating and add #water one#egg
                        #chickenbreast: my family doesn’t like bone but chicken
                        with bone tastes much better
                      </li>
                      <li>vegetable oil: for deep fry</li>

                      I have some leftover during the lunch time. So, I only
                      used half cauliflower.First of all, I boiled the
                      cauliflower in the salty water until it is soft. There are
                      some inside leaves from cauliflower. It also tastes good
                      by boiling it or stir frying it. The outside one is the
                      harder one. I keep them for guinea pigs. After boiling the
                      cauliflower, let it cool down and then you can start to
                      make the coating. Dip the cauliflower into flour, then egg
                      wash and then breadcrumb. After it, put it into the hot
                      oil and deep fry until crispy. Nothing fancy but tasty.

                      lunch. I gave two pieces fried cauliflowes to my kid. She
                      said it is chicken (FYI: she loves chicken)… but after two
                      pieces, she only ate potatoes… So, I tried but it is

                      Ok, I am not Slovak but my husband is. Living in Germany
                      may not find Slovak food easily. Then, my husband taught
                      (a.k.a forced) me to learn. Fried Cauliflower (Slovak
                      name: Vyprážaný Karfiol) is one of popular dish in
                      Slovakia if you eat outside. Below is my version.

                      Chenpi is a sun-dried tangerine peel. In Hong Kong, it
                      uses on different dishes such as red bean soup, congee,
                      steam fish, fish ball or just put into a hot water like
                      tea. Surely you can find it in the Asian store. But you
                      have no idea what chemical stuff it added on the peel… and
                      the good quality and few-year-sun-tried chenpi is very
                      expensive. So I decided to prepare my own chenpi.

                    <p>
                      Actually it is not so messy. Just peel off the skin of
                      tangerine and remove stem and the white “meat” (albedo) as
                      much as possible by a knife. Then dry under the sun for 3
                      days. After it, you can store it into tight seal glass and
                      keep it in cool area. Every year, you just need to put
                      under the sun for a while and then you can keep very long
                      time…
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      According to some websites, if the sun-dried tangerine
                      peel is called chenpi, it needs to dry minimum 3 years. If
                      not, it only can be called sun-dried peel… so, I tried but
                      it still has 154 weeks to go….
